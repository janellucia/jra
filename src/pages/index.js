          <p>Due to covid-19 we, like everyone, have been closed. We are closely monitoring the situation and want to prepare as best we can for when it is time to open back up.</p>
          <p>As soon as we understand when we may be able to open we will activate a link for online booking.</p>
          <p> Thank you very much for your patience and we really look forward to being able to serve our clients again.</p>
